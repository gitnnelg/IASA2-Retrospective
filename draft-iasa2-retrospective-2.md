# Second IASA2 Retrospective

## Reason for This Document

BCP 101 / RFC 8711 specifies a requirement to conduct a [three-year
retrospective](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8711.html#name-three-year-assessment
) of the IETF Administrative Support Activity version 2.0 (IASA2). That was completed in 2021 (https://www.ietf.org/media/documents/IASA2_Retrospective.pdf), and the 
first recommendation was that these should occure every three years (see below). This is the second IASA2 retrospective, and 
future retrospectives should be published in 2027, 2030, 2033, and so on every three years. 

> The IETF LLC should conduct a regular assessment of the IASA structure and
   IETF LLC every three years, with a report to the IETF community in the final
   IETF meeting of each of those years. Based on this IASA2 retrospective being
   completed in 2021, the next IASA assessments should occur in 2024, 2027,
   2030, 2033, and so on.
> 
> The point of performing a regular assessment is that the IETF's way of
   working and its needs will continue to evolve, while the external environment
   will also change. Thus, periodically checking in to see whether there are
   structural, process, financial, operational, legal, or other administrative
   adaptations are needed makes sense. As well, by making small changes on an
   incremental basis, the risks associated with each change is likely to be
   smaller because the changes are correspondingly smaller, and there is a
   regular check-in every three years at which point the IETF can assess the
   effectiveness of any change so that modest course corrections can be made.
   Finally, keeping up with internal and external changes may also potentially
   help the IETF avoid large once-a-decade administrative structure changes that
   are multi-year efforts like IASA2 - and this is not only a time-saver but
   also lets IETF leaders and participants remain more focused on the core
   standards work of the IETF.
> 
> In addition, as the IETF evolves how the organization wishes to work and meet
   in a post-COVID world, such as potentially changing meeting frequency,
   reducing in-person venue size requirements, shifting to hybrid meetings, and
   so on, the IETF LLC will need to adapt to provide the necessary
   administrative, operational, legal, financial, and other support to meet the
   changing needs of the IETF.

# Note on Form 

In the first IASA2 retrospective, we reviewed a list of 62 requirments. Most of those were met, so in order to reduce the 
length of this document and focus on what has changed since 2021, we will not reproduce the full list here.

# Requirements and Responsibilities


## A. [BCP 101 / RFC 8711](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8711.html) Requirements

1. **Requirement:** Fundraising. The IETF LLC is responsible for raising money
   on behalf of the IETF.

   **Status:**  &#x1F7E2; Achieved / On Track

   **Comments:** See new ISOC funding agreement with special matching funds
   ([part
   1](https://www.ietf.org/media/documents/IETF_Funding_Agreement_-_Executed_-_20201123.pdf)
   and [part
   2](https://www.ietf.org/media/documents/IETF_ISOC_Funding_Amendment_Amendment_-_20201222.pdf)),
   and announcement of [recruitment for
   fundraiser](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ietf-announce/qsdI5pBW41G9BN_aGsdJ7pe5Rvk/).

### [Section 7.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8711.html#name-ietf-meeting-revenues) - IETF Meeting Revenues

2. **Requirement**: Meeting revenues are another important source of funding
    that supports the IETF, coming mainly from the fees paid by IETF meeting
    participants. The IETF Executive Director sets those meeting fees, in
    consultation with other IETF LLC staff and the IETF community, with approval
    by the IETF LLC Board. Setting these fees and projecting the number of
    participants at future meetings is a key part of the annual budget process.

    **Status:** &#x1F7E2; Achieved / On Track with Caveat

    **Comments:** The only change to meeting fees was the introduction of an
    online meeting fee, which was necessary as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic
    forcing the IETF to temporarily shift away from in-person meetings. In this
    case, fees were proposed and adjusted based on community feedback and in a
    manner to ensure the continued financial stability of the IETF.

    _In retrospect, there should have been earlier consultation on the fees and
    specifically the fee waiver system._ While the Board initially assessed that
    the fee waiver system already in place for regular meetings should apply to
    online meetings too (including the need to motivate a fee waiver request),
    this was rejected strongly by the community. In summary, it is our
    assessment that while the LLC mis-stepped initially, it rapidly adjusted the
    plans for IETF-108 based on community feedback and quickly reached consensus
    on its final plans.

    Initial signs of health issues that would affect IETF-107 taking place in
    March 2020 in Vancouver led to an [advisory concerning travel
    restrictions](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ietf-announce/hNRWBvEwgwQIapmNtw2EP1uIS1o/)
    on 2 February 2020 and a note that the IETF was [continuing to monitor the
    situation](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ietf-announce/TA9rALRWCqB2Y1AX9XjSWeX31-w/)
    and would offer refunds on 12 February 2020. This was followed by an update[
    on 24 February
    2020](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ietf-announce/legMcsx2H_OEVLVtyESt_O-7qmY/)
    that the LLC was monitoring events and potential issues that may prevent
    meeting in person in March 2020 and a further update on [4 March
    2020](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ietf-announce/uMUo7ib0WfVmnXeulBl0-RqENcs/).
    This culminated in an [announcement on 10 March
    2020](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ietf-announce/WnC93yQanxb1GhOGYU97vFxc5RU/)
    that IETF-107 would not take place in person, refunds would be processed,
    and that a short virtual meeting would instead be held. The LLC also
    announced a process to analyze the financial impacts of the need to hold
    meetings exclusively online for some period and an intent to explore a
    potential insurance claim resulting from cancellation of IETF-107 (which was
    later successfully paid in the amount of $426,118).

    A change to meeting fees was motivated in response to the events that
    followed the World Health Organization's [pandemic declaration on 11 March
    2020](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/transcripts/who-audio-emergencies-coronavirus-press-conference-full-and-final-11mar2020.pdf?sfvrsn=cb432bb3_2),
    which confirmed the LLC's concern that meetings would need to move entirely
    online for the foreseeable future. In the remaining weeks of March 2020,
    countries around the world began to implement travel restrictions and bans,
    as well as stay-at-home orders - initially fairly short-term in nature. The
    world's understanding of the nature, potential severity, and likely long
    duration further developed through late March and early April 2020. The IETF
    LLC meeting fee assessment process began with an initial consultation
    concerning the move to online meetings on [16 April
    2020](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ietf-announce/IEfubIxgzcSC8wbNDRGgOU2sqck/),
    then a [survey on 29 April
    2020](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ietf-announce/GnuYHU6NnClmN2qpig9Q3FkkJYE/),
    a [survey reminder on 4 May
    2020](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ietf-announce/-u1O8RpCMsu5qRrC1mFx4jKVPSY/),
    announced [decision-making
    framework](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ietf-announce/BJ2DlWjqwm3N2O4_7voSq2bGfKM/)
    on 7 May 2020, posted [decision-making framework and next
    steps](https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/108/assessment-framework-person-vs-online-ietf-108-meeting/)
    on 7 May 2020, announced [survey
    results](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ietf-announce/ME5DcMMYssP2YV7GKzMBREh4wic/)
    on 12 May 2020, [announced shift to an online
    meeting](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ietf-announce/kzC7M48oKrAwdh9uyOvseeKFW3A/)
    for IETF 108 on 14 May 2020, [analysis of survey
    results](https://www.ietf.org/blog/ietf108-survey-results-informed-planning/)
    on 21 May 2020, [assessment of financial impacts and
    costs](https://www.ietf.org/blog/ietf108-registration-fees/) on 27 May 2020,
    draft [fee
    structure](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ietf-announce/TH2O7LE5WyoG60A3ERoKVz53x2E/)
    announced on 28 May 2020, announcement of first [online-only meeting
    registration](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ietf-announce/BPNyTxka355XbY03VSBtjl5y_So/)
    on 8 June 2020 which included a fee waiver program based on community
    feedback, [proposed change to and consultation on the fee waiver
    program](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ietf-announce/fVsDPW9hbgx5mflHpt7C39uFD0s/)
    based on community feedback, and [finalization of the fee waiver
    program](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ietf-announce/B6mndcJUVrU1tNkx0ueVQkawlLU/)
    for IETF-108 on 19 June 2020.

    The adjusted budgets, based around reduced fees and reduced sponsorship
    levels, have proven sufficiently accurate with all online meetings making a
    small surplus/loss, as budgeted.

    While the LLC at the time identified an area of improvement to the fee
    consultation process, in retrospect we believe that in the bigger picture
    the shift to online meetings was executed successfully in the face of an
    unprecedented global crisis, in the short period of time necessitated by
    these unforeseen external events, and with minimal financial impact to the
    organization, preserving a key revenue stream and ensuring the ongoing
    financial stability of the IETF.  Our [reforecast 2020
    budget](https://www.ietf.org/media/documents/ietf-2020-budget-reforecast-f1-approved.pdf)
    and [2020 Audited
    Financials](https://www.ietf.org/media/documents/2020_Audited_Financials.pdf)
    provide further details.

    See also an associated recommendation in Section E below.

### [Section 7.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8711.html#name-sponsorships-and-donations-) - Sponsorships and Donations to the IETF LLC

3. **Requirement**: Sponsorships and donations are an essential component of
    the financial support for the IETF. Within the general bounds noted in
    Section 7.8, the IETF LLC is responsible for fundraising activities in order
    to establish, maintain, and grow a strong foundation of donation revenues.
    This can and does include both direct financial contributions as well as
    in-kind contributions, such as equipment, software licenses, and services.

    Sponsorships and donations to the IETF LLC do not (and must not) convey to
    sponsors and donors any special oversight or direct influence over the
    IETF's technical work or other activities of the IETF or IETF LLC. This
    helps ensure that no undue influence may be ascribed to those from whom
    funds are raised, and so helps to maintain an open and consensus-based IETF
    standards process.

    To the extent that the IETF LLC needs to undertake any significant special
    projects for the IETF, the IETF LLC may need to fund-raise distinctly for
    those special projects. As a result, the IETF LLC may conduct fundraising to
    support the IETF in general as well as one or more special fundraising
    efforts (which may also be accounted for distinctly and be held in a
    separate bank account or investment, as needed).

    **Status:** &#x1F7E2; Achieved / On Track

    **Comments:** The [new 2020 agreement with the Internet
    Society](https://www.ietf.org/blog/isoc-financial-commitment/) created a new
    fundraising matching funds program, designed to help create a strong
    foundation from which to accelerate new fundraising.

    A [revised sponsorship
    program](https://www.ietf.org/blog/revised-ietf-sponsorship-program/) was
    then announced on 2 March 2021. In the new structure, most opportunities are
    presented as annual or multi-year commitments with benefits that extend
    across and beyond meetings. In addition, there are new values-based
    categories to support running code, diversity and inclusion, and
    sustainability. These include programs such as IETF Hackathons, meeting
    registration fee waivers, and initiatives designed to reduce our impact on
    the environment.  Meeting-focused opportunities remain a part of the mix. An
    organization may host a meeting not already supported by a Global Host.
    Likewise, separate welcome reception sponsorship opportunities remain, and
    organizations local to an in-person meeting may be a sponsor for that
    meeting. Equipment and services sponsors will continue to be recognized for
    the  support they provide our community's ongoing operations.

    Finally, the hiring of a Director of Development [was
    announced](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ietf-announce/x9Aacw1UlNqAoQSxbJbyrZZ8IPU/)
    on 8 June 2021 and that person is in charge of leading fundraising for the
    IETF. Their hiring reflects the priority that the LLC places on this
    critical activity.


### [Section 7.9](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8711.html#name-operating-reserve) - Operating Reserves

4. **Requirement**: An initial target operating reserve has been specified in
    Exhibit B of the [IETF LLC
    Agreement](https://www.ietf.org/documents/180/IETF-LLC-Agreement.pdf). It
    says that the IETF LLC should maintain an operating reserve equal to the
    IETF LLC's budgeted Net Loss for 2019 multiplied times three. The IETF LLC,
    in cooperation with ISOC, may regularly review the financial target for this
    reserve fund, as noted in the  [IETF LLC
    Agreement](https://www.ietf.org/documents/180/IETF-LLC-Agreement.pdf) or as
    otherwise necessary.

    Should the IETF LLC generate an annual budget surplus, it may choose to
    direct all or part of the surplus towards the growth of the operating
    reserve.

    **Status:** &#x1F7E2; Achieved / With Suggested Action Items

    **Comments:** The LLC continued to maintain an operating reserve fund. As of
    June 2021, the operating reserve balance is over $5,200,0001. The LLC
    believes this reserve is sufficient at this time, based on the
    organization's projected expenses.

    In addition, we propose two financial-related actions that should be made a
    part of the IETF LLC's annual budget process. First, the LLC should annually
    update and specify the financial target for reserve-related funds. Second,
    the LLC should annually review all reserve-related funds and the [Investment
    Policy](https://www.ietf.org/media/documents/IETF_IPS_ADOPTED_20191218_REDACTED.pdf),
    and update these as necessary. These reviews would be best timed to coincide
    with the annual budget process.

### [Section 7.10](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8711.html#name-annual-budget-process) - Annual Budget Process

5. **Requirement**: Improve the IETF's Technical Environment. Undertake changes
    to better enable technical contributors to focus more on that technical work
    and less on administrative work or support activities.  This could for
    example mean directing more financial resources towards the creation of new
    or improvement of existing tools, which might be produced by contractors
    rather than solely by volunteers.  As a result, volunteers could instead
    focus on developing the standards themselves.  Thus, if the core competency
    of IETF attendees and their reason for participating in the IETF is to
    develop standards, then create an environment where they can focus
    exclusively on that activity and delegate to contractors, staff, or other
    resources the responsibility for creating and maintaining tools and
    processes to support this activity.

    **Status:** &#x1F7E1; In Progress

    **Comments:** This remains a key focus for the LLC, as there continues to be
    technical debt that needs to be addressed, and the IETF wishes to move
    towards more modern software architecture, systems architecture, software
    development practices and user-centered design.  The current short-term
    focus is migrating core services off of tools.ietf.org onto managed IETF
    servers with a mix of like-for-like services, switching to new services
    (such as from Trac to GitHub) and replacing existing services with enhanced
    functionality. Resourcing continues to be a limiting factor and the LLC has
    increased the use of existing contractors, cultivated new contractors, and
    employed two new Senior Software Development Engineers to address this
    limitation, thus providing more capacity to take on a greater volume of
    technical work.

    We also observed that tension arose in the process of working towards
    meeting this requirement, as the LLC attempted (as required) to better
    define roles, responsibilities, and accountability between contractors and
    volunteers - especially when an individual was simultaneously both a
    contractor and a volunteer in a specific context. This appears to have been
    resolved and as the technical platforms of the IETF evolve it appears that
    roles, responsibilities, and accountabilities are becoming more clear-cut
    and easier to understand.

6. **Requirement**: Support a Re-Envisioned Funding Model: Provide the staff
    support and resources needed to adapt the funding model of the IETF to
    changes in the industry, participation, and expenses.  The structure should
    also allow for and be able to support new funding streams or changes to the
    proportion of funds from various Sources.

    **Status:** &#x1F7E2; Achieved / On Track

    **Comments:** As noted in Requirement 38, a new agreement with ISOC was
    [announced on 30 November
    2020](https://www.ietf.org/blog/isoc-financial-commitment/), which includes
    a novel new matching funds component. The executed 16 November 2020
    [agreement is
    posted](https://www.ietf.org/media/documents/IETF_Funding_Agreement_-_Executed_-_20201123.pdf),
    as is a [brief amendment
    ](https://www.ietf.org/media/documents/IETF_ISOC_Funding_Amendment_Amendment_-_20201222.pdf) from
    22 December 2020. In addition, as noted previously, there is now a fee
    structure in place for [online
    meetings](https://www.ietf.org/blog/ietf108-registration-fees/) to react to
    pandemic-driven changes in how we can meet, a [revised sponsorship
    program](https://www.ietf.org/blog/revised-ietf-sponsorship-program/), and a
    new [ Director of
    Development](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ietf-announce/x9Aacw1UlNqAoQSxbJbyrZZ8IPU/)
    on staff. The LLC anticipates that over the next 5 to 10 years that the
    funding sources will diversify as a result of these changes and investments.


### [Section 5.6.2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-haberman-iasa20dt-recs-03#section-5.6.2) - Funding Sources and Stability

7. **Requirement**: See the [several paragraphs in the IASA2 Design Team
    Recommendations
    document](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-haberman-iasa20dt-recs-03#section-5.6.2),
    which concludes with a main point:

    > ...developing a sustainable funding plan
    for the IETF will be a key project during the early months and years
    post-IASA 2.0.  Ultimately a healthier funding model will require raising
    more funds from the organizations that benefit from IETF standards and whose
    employees participate in the IETF, and may result in less reliance on ISOC
    funds.  Such a model might incorporate meeting-based sponsorships as we have
    traditionally had, other kinds of sponsorships, a fully funded endowment, a
    different registration fee structure, or other funding vehicles.

    **Status:** &#x1F7E1; Partly Achieved / In Progress

    **Comments:** During the IASA2 transition and bootstrapping process, we are
    pleased that pre-existing sponsors and funding was maintained. In addition,
    a [new funding
    agreement](https://www.ietf.org/blog/isoc-financial-commitment/) with a
    novel matching program has been agreed upon with ISOC. There is also a
    [revised sponsorship
    program](https://www.ietf.org/blog/revised-ietf-sponsorship-program/) that
    is successfully attracting interest and incremental funding, a [revised
    endowment
    policy](https://www.ietf.org/about/administration/policies-procedures/endowment-policy/),
    a structure for [online-only meeting registration
    fees](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ietf-announce/B6mndcJUVrU1tNkx0ueVQkawlLU/),
    and a newly hired Director of Development to lead the IETF's fundraising
    efforts. These are all long-term efforts that will take time to bear fruit.

    However, one area for action is determining what the meeting registration
    structure should look like for a post-COVID-19 era of hybrid meetings. On 30
    August 2021, the IETF LLC opened [a
    consultation](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ietf-announce/Pw1FOZyVnfyxBLADDwqdiMZW4E0/)
    on this question and associated issues. In addition, the IESG is in the
    process of rechartering the [SHMOO working
    group](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/shmoo/about/) to expand its focus
    from online meetings to hybrid meetings. This will now be the subject of an
    upcoming IETF LLC-IESG-IAB-IRTF leadership workshop in 2021. Finally, it is
    expected that IETF-113 in March 2022 may be the first hybrid IETF meeting.

    See also an associated recommendation in Section E below.

## D. Other Gaps

The IETF LLC also asked an open-ended question of the IETF community, seeking
suggestions on any additional administrative, financial, legal, or operational
gaps; areas of improvement; and any areas of under-specification or
over-specification in IASA2 documents that the IETF LLC Board, IETF Secretariat,
IETF Executive Director, or the IETF community perceive that have not already
been addressed in prior sections of this document. No comments were received in
this area that have not already been addressed in prior sections of this
document.

Finally, the IETF LLC specifically asked whether retrospectives like this should
be performed in the future and the feedback was that this did have value. The
associated action item for that has been noted below in Section E.

## E. Recommendations for Future Work

1. Continue performing a regular assessment of the IASA structure and
   IETF LLC every three years, with a report to the IETF community in the final
   IETF meeting of each of those years. The next IASA assessments should occur in 2027,
   2030, 2033, and so on.

   The point of performing a regular assessment is that the IETF's way of
   working and its needs will continue to evolve, while the external environment
   will also change. Thus, periodically checking in to see whether there are
   structural, process, financial, operational, legal, or other administrative
   adaptations are needed makes sense. As well, by making small changes on an
   incremental basis, the risks associated with each change is likely to be
   smaller because the changes are correspondingly smaller, and there is a
   regular check-in every three years at which point the IETF can assess the
   effectiveness of any change so that modest course corrections can be made.
   Finally, keeping up with internal and external changes may also potentially
   help the IETF avoid large once-a-decade administrative structure changes that
   are multi-year efforts like IASA2 - and this is not only a time-saver but
   also lets IETF leaders and participants remain more focused on the core
   standards work of the IETF.

   In addition, as the IETF evolves how the organization wishes to work and meet
   in a post-COVID world, such as potentially changing meeting frequency,
   reducing in-person venue size requirements, shifting to hybrid meetings, and
   so on, the IETF LLC will need to adapt to provide the necessary
   administrative, operational, legal, financial, and other support to meet the
   changing needs of the IETF.

2. As noted in the comments part of Requirement 43, we recommend two
   financial-related actions that should be made a part of the IETF LLC's annual
   budget process. First, the LLC should annually update and specify the
   financial target for reserve-related funds. Second, the LLC should annually
   review all reserve-related funds and the [Investment
   Policy](https://www.ietf.org/media/documents/IETF_IPS_ADOPTED_20191218_REDACTED.pdf),
   and update these as necessary. These reviews would be best timed to coincide
   with the annual budget process.

3. As noted in the comments part of Requirement 63, we recommend that the IETF
   Trust initiate a community consultation concerning improvements in their
   legal structure.
