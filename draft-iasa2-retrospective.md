# IASA2 Retrospective

## Reason for This Document

BCP 101 / RFC 8711 specifies a requirement to conduct a [three-year
retrospective](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8711.html#name-three-year-assessment
) of the IETF Administrative Support Activity version 2.0 (IASA2). This
requirement is being met in the report below, by extracting requirements and
goals from documents developed during the IASA2 process, evaluating each of
them, and assessing performance on those requirements and goals.

   and rules.

   **Status:**  &#x1F7E2; Achieved

   **Comments:** The IETF LLC [publishes its
   policies](https://www.ietf.org/about/administration/policies-procedures/ )
   and provides a [compliance
   video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scL7oqpHfD4) to assist covered
   individuals in reading these policies.

### [Section 4.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8711.html#name-ietf-llc-working-principles) - IETF Working Principles

5. **Requirement:** Transparency. The IETF LLC is expected to keep the IETF
   community informed about its work, subject to reasonable confidentiality
   concerns, and to engage with the community to obtain consensus-based
   community input on key issues and otherwise as needed. The IETF community
   expects complete visibility into the financial and legal structure of the
   IETF LLC. This includes information about the IETF LLC annual budget and
   associated regular financial reports, results of financial and any other
   independent audits, tax filings, significant contracts, or other significant
   long-term financial commitments that bind the IETF LLC. Whatever doesn't have
   a specific justification for being kept confidential is expected to be made
   public. The Board is expected to develop and maintain a public list of
   confidential items, describing the nature of the information and the reason
   for confidentiality. The Board will also publish its operating procedures.

   **Status:** &#x1F7E2; Achieved

   **Comments:** The IETF LLC Board meets monthly, with meetings open to the
   community. The only items kept confidential relate to contract negotiations,
   contractor reviews, personnel matters or in some cases the exact financial
   rates in published contracts. The same level of transparency and access
   applies to the yearly IETF LLC Board strategic meetings. All items are
   available on the [IETF LLC
   webpage](https://www.ietf.org/about/administration).

6. **Requirement:** Responsiveness to the community. The IETF LLC is expected to
   act consistently with the documented consensus of the IETF community, to be
   responsive to the community's needs, and to adapt its decisions in response
   to consensus-based community feedback.

   **Status:** &#x1F7E2; Achieved

   **Comments:** The IETF LLC has focused most of its energy the last three
   years on executing on the documented consensus of the IETF community based in
   the formative BCPs and RFCs pertaining to IASA2, covered in this
   retrospective. The IETF LLC has also conducted extensive community
   consultations, such as in 2019 for the [development of required
   policies](https://www.ietf.org/blog/ietf-llc-draft-policies-comment/). Since
   the IETF LLC formed, [more than a dozen
   consultations](https://www.ietf.org/about/administration/announcements/) have
   been conducted, as well as several surveys of the IETF community. Decisions
   have also been adapted based on community feedback, such as relating to the
   IETF's initial policies, our privacy policy, and fees for online-only
   meetings. In addition, when suggestions have been made the Board has
   responded (e.g., creating office hours during IETF meetings).

7. **Requirement:** Diligence. The IETF LLC is expected to act responsibly so as
   to minimize risks to IETF participants and to the future of the IETF as a
   whole, such as financial risks.

   **Status:** &#x1F7E2; Achieved

   **Comments:** The IETF LLC has worked hard to minimize strategic risks to the
   IETF and participants. To use one recent example, the IETF LLC ensured that
   during the COVID-19 pandemic the IETF was able to shift to online meetings
   with effective tools while maintaining the financial viability of the
   organizationâ€”something with which other organizations struggled financially
   or operationally. However, the IETF was informed of a security vulnerability
   in the meeting t-shirt request system which was [announced in April
   2021](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ietf-announce/exMKqyRTCeEqNPicXLJv5GmQdoQ/)
   and subsequently mitigated.

8. **Requirement:** Unification. The IETF LLC provides the corporate legal home
   for the IETF, the Internet Architecture Board ([IAB](https://www.iab.org/)),
   and the Internet Research Task Force ([IRTF](https://irtf.org/)), and
   financial support for the operation of the [RFC
   Editor](https://www.rfc-editor.org/).

   **Status:** &#x1F7E2; Achieved

   **Comments:** This was achieved in the initial set of [legal agreements
   related to the formation of the IETF
   LLC](https://www.ietf.org/about/administration/overview/).

9. **Requirement:** Transfer or Dissolution. Consistent with the [IETF LLC
   Agreement](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8711.html#IETF-LLC-A), the IETF
   LLC subsidiary may be transferred from ISOC to another organization, at the
   request of either party. Similarly, the IETF LLC may be dissolved if
   necessary. Should either event occur, the IETF community should be closely
   involved in any decisions and plans. Any transfer, transition, or dissolution
   should be conducted carefully and with minimal potential disruption to the
   IETF.

   **Status:** &#x1F7E2; In Place

   **Comments:** The policy framework for such a move is in place, should it
   need to occur. See Section 12, Transfer of Membership Interest, and Section
   13, Dissolution, in the [2018 Limited Liability Company Agreement of IETF
   Administration
   LLC](https://www.ietf.org/documents/180/IETF-LLC-Agreement.pdf).

### [Section 5.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8711.html#name-ietf-executive-director-and) - IETF Executive Director and Staff Responsibilities

10. **Requirement:** Developing and refining an annual budget and other
    strategic financial planning documents at the direction of the Board.

    **Status:** &#x1F7E2; Achieved

    **Comments:** See annual budget, financial statements, audit reports, and
    other finance-related documents on the [relevant IETF LLC web
    page](https://www.ietf.org/about/administration/financial-statements/).

11. **Requirement:** Executing on the annual budget, including reporting to the
    Board regularly with forecasts and actual performance to budget.

    **Status:** &#x1F7E2; Achieved

    **Comments:** See annual budget, financial statements, audit reports, and
    other finance-related documents on the [relevant IETF LLC web
    page](https://www.ietf.org/about/administration/financial-statements/). For
    regular reports to the Board, see monthly meeting minutes on the [Board
    Minutes and Materials web
    page](https://www.ietf.org/about/groups/llc-board/minutes/).

12. **Requirement:** Hiring and/or contracting the necessary resources to meet
    their goals, within the defined limits of the IETF Executive Director's
    authority and within the approved budget. This includes managing and leading
    any such resources, including performing regular performance reviews.

    **Status:** &#x1F7E2; Achieved

    **Comments:** The IETF Executive Director has brought in resources
    consistent with this, such as a Director of Communications and Operations,
    Director of Development, and two Senior Software Development Engineers.

13. **Requirement:** Following the pre-approval guidelines set forth by the
    Board for contracts or other decisions that have financial costs that exceed
    a certain threshold of significance. Such thresholds are expected to be set
    reasonably high so that the need for such approvals is infrequent and only
    occurs when something is truly significant or otherwise exceptional. It is
    expected that the IETF Executive Director is sufficiently empowered to
    perform the job on a day-to-day basis, being held accountable for meeting
    high-level goals rather than being micromanaged.

    **Status:** &#x1F7E2; Achieved

    **Comments:** This is documented in the [Delegated Authorities
    policy](https://www.ietf.org/media/documents/IETF_LLC_Delegated_Authorities_2020-06-11.pdf).

14. **Requirement:** Regularly updating the Board on operations and other
    notable issues as reasonable and appropriate.

    **Status:** &#x1F7E2; Achieved

    **Comments:** The Executive Director has a standing agenda item each Board
    meeting to present a report, such as in the [May 2021 meeting for
    example](https://www.ietf.org/media/documents/2021-05-13-llc-board-agenda.pdf).
    This report is subsequently documented in meeting minutes, such as in the
    [April 2021 meeting minutes for
    example](https://www.ietf.org/media/documents/2021-04-08-llc-board-minutes.pdf).

15. **Requirement:** Ensuring that all staff and/or other resources comply with
    any applicable policies established or approved by the Board, such as ethics
    guidelines and/or a code of conduct.

    **Status:** &#x1F7E2; Achieved

    **Comments:** The Executive Director ensures that all staff and/or
    contractors comply with appropriate policies. In addition, the Board
    established a [Whistleblower
    Policy](https://www.ietf.org/about/administration/policies-procedures/whistleblower/)
    as one mechanism for people to use if they believe that someone is not
    following policies.

### [Section 5.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8711.html#name-ietf-llc-board-responsibili) - IETF LLC Board Responsibilities

Key IETF LLC Board responsibilities include:

16. **Requirement:** Setting broad strategic direction for the LLC.

    **Status:** &#x1F7E2; Achieved

    **Comments:** The Board has done so in a number of ways, including
    conducting a [strategic plan
    consultation](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ietf-announce/eZIc0kfb26lQXLwR9PiwX7-h5dI/)
    and releasing a [strategic
    plan](https://github.com/ietf-llc/strategy-2020-consultation/blob/latest-updates-from-consultation/DRAFT%20Strategic%20Plan%202020.md).
    Development of this plan was also informed by the Internet Engineering

    activities. and members of the IESG participated in the IETF LLC strategic
    planning process.

17. **Requirement:** Hiring or terminating an IETF Executive Director (or
    amending the terms of their engagement).

    **Status:** &#x1F7E2; Achieved

    **Comments:** [Jay Daley was
    hired](https://www.ietf.org/blog/welcome-ietf-exec-director/) into this role
    and started on 24 October 2019.

18. **Requirement:** Delegating management of day-to-day activities and related

    required
    policies](https://www.ietf.org/blog/ietf-llc-draft-policies-comment/). Since
    the IETF LLC formed, [more than a dozen
    consultations](https://www.ietf.org/about/administration/announcements/)
    have been conducted as well as several surveys of the IETF community.
    Decisions have also been adapted based on community feedback, such as
    relating to the IETF's initial policies, our privacy policy, and fees for
    online-only meetings.

21. **Requirement:** Approving any changes to the LLC governance structure.

    **Status:** &#x1F7E2; Achieved

    **Comments:** Other than approving all of the LLC's initial policies, no
    significant changes to the LLC's governance structure have been made.

22. **Requirement:** Adopting an annual budget and, as necessary, incur any
    debt.

    the [Board/ED Delegated
    Authorities](https://www.ietf.org/media/documents/IETF_LLC_Delegated_Authorities_2020-06-11.pdf)
    policy.

26. **Requirement:** Limiting its activities to the purposes as set forth in
    [Section 4 of the LLC
    Agreement](https://www.ietf.org/media/documents/IETF-LLC-Agreement.pdf), in
    a manner consistent with ISOC's charitable purposes.

29. **Requirement:** Ensuring that IETF LLC is run in a manner that is
    transparent and accountable to the IETF community.

    **Status:** &#x1F7E2; Achieved

    **Comments:** See also Requirement 5 above. The IETF LLC Board meets
    monthly, with meetings open to the community. The only items kept
    confidential relate to contract negotiations, contractor reviews, personnel
    matters or in some cases the exact financial rates in published contracts.
    All items are available on the [IETF LLC
    webpage](https://www.ietf.org/about/administration). The IETF LLC has also
    conducted extensive community consultations, such as in 2019 for the
    [development of required
    policies](https://www.ietf.org/blog/ietf-llc-draft-policies-comment/). Since
    the IETF LLC formed, [more than a dozen
    consultations](https://www.ietf.org/about/administration/announcements/)
    have been conducted as well as several surveys of the IETF community.
    Decisions have also been adapted based on community feedback, such as
    relating to the IETF's initial policies, our privacy policy, and fees for
    online-only meetings.

30. **Requirement:** Developing policies, including those noted in [Section
    8](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8711.html#llc-policies), procedures,
    and a compliance program.

    **Status:** &#x1F7E2; Achieved

    **Comments:** The LLC developed a number of [policies and
    procedures](https://www.ietf.org/about/administration/policies-procedures/),
    as well as a compliance program. This includes a Code of Conduct, Conflict

    Minutes Approval Policy, Investment Policy, Board/ED Delegated Authorities
    Policy, Accounting Policy, Objectively False IPR Disclosure Policy, Records
    Retention Schedule, Charitable Contribution Acceptance Policy, and OFAC
    Compliance Policy.

31. **Requirement:** Obtaining Commercial General Liability and other
    appropriate insurance policies, with agreed-upon coverage limits.

    **Status:** &#x1F7E2; Achieved

    **Comments:** The LLC has obtained all necessary and recommended insurance
    policies, following a review of existing policies and their coverage limits
    to ensure appropriate levels of insurance. This includes insurance for
    Business Liability, Electronic Liability, Employee Benefits Liability,
    Employment Practices Liability, Employers Liability Coverage, Worker
    Compensation, Property Insurance, General Liability, Commercial Liability,
    Media Liability, Accidental Death, Kidnap and Extortion, Directors and
    Officers, Fraud Coverage, Inland Marine, Cyber Liability, and Event
    Cancellation. The LLC has also made an insurance claim pertaining to
    IETF-107, which was canceled due to COVID-19 and has subsequently received a
    payment on this claim. However, increasing the insurance for the IETF Trust has proven problematic as noted in Requirement 63 below.

32. **Requirement:** Recruiting new Directors for consideration in all of the
    various appointment processes.

    **Status:** &#x1F7E2; Achieved

    **Comments:** This requirement is more fully explained in [Section 6.3 of
    RFC
    8711](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8711.html#name-recruiting-ietf-llc-board-d).
    The LLC's interim Board and inaugural Board have both complied with this
    requirement. The interim Board worked to recruit candidates to meet various
    requirements and a mix of skills, experience, and independence from the
    IETF. From the inaugural Board to the current Board, the Board has

    1. appointed a liaison to each of the three IETF Nominating Committees
    (NomComs) since the creation of the LLC and

    2. provided requirements to the
    IETF NomCom and ISOC Board (for the ISOC-appointed Director).

    The Board has so far not sought to recruit Board-appointed Directors. See
    also the response to Requirement 34 below.

### [Section 5.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8711.html#name-board-design-goals) - Board Design Goals

33. **Requirement**: Meet the following goals: <sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>

    - Balance the need for the IETF LLC to be accountable to the IETF community
      with the need for this Board to have the expertise necessary to oversee a
      small non-profit company.

    - Focus on the limited set of strategic responsibilities as noted in
      [Section 5.2 of RFC
      8711](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8711.html#name-ietf-llc-board-responsibili)
      (enumerated here in Requirements 16 - 32).

    - Overcome the challenges described in [Section 3.1.4 of the IASA 2.0 Design
      Team
      Recommendations](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-haberman-iasa20dt-recs-03#section-3.1.4)
      concerning oversight.

    - Operate transparently to address issues noted in [Section 3.3 of the IASA
      2.0 Design Team
      Recommendations](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-haberman-iasa20dt-recs-03#section-3.3).

    **Status:** &#x1F7E2; Achieved

    **Comments:** The LLC has operated in a manner that meets this requirement.
    In particular, it has met the oversight requirement by hiring two staff
    members as well as contractors to fulfill functions previously provided by
    the Internet Society and the LLC Board, with the LLC Executive Director now
    having direct oversight of those people to meet this requirement. As well,
    the transparency requirements have been met as noted in the response to
    Requirement 5 above. In addition, the Board has adopted policies to ensure
    accountability to the IETF (as noted earlier in this document) and has
    operated consistent with those policies. Finally, the current Board has
    demonstrated that it has the expertise necessary to oversee a small
    non-profit company and the mechanisms for populating the Board have worked.

### [Section 6.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8711.html#name-board-composition) - Board Composition

34. **Requirement**: There is a minimum of 5 Directors, which is expandable to 6
    or 7:
    - 1 IETF Chair or delegate selected by the IESG
    - 1 Appointed by the ISOC Board of Trustees
    - 3 Selected by the IETF Nominating Committee (NomCom), confirmed by the
      IESG
    - Up to 2 Appointed by the IETF LLC Board itself, on an as-needed basis,
      confirmed by the IESG

    **Status:** &#x1F7E2; Achieved

    **Comments:** The Board has not exceeded 5 Directors since the inaugural
    Board was formed. The Board has so far not found it necessary to appoint
    additional Board members and has found that keeping the number of Board
    members to 5 has served as a natural limiter of Board attention, meaning it
    has kept the Board focused on the most important and strategic issues rather
    than getting into a level of detail that is best performed by staff,
    contractors, or volunteers. It remains to be seen whether in the future the
    Board will find it useful to appoint up to two additional Directors on an
    as-needed basis, though having the option to do so appears to remain a
    valuable attribute of the IASA2 structure.

    In addition, despite the debate during the IASA2 WG process over whether the
    IETF NomCom process was well-suited to assess non-technical and
    non-IETF-related expertise, such as management, budget and fundraising
    experience, it appears that the NomCom process has worked successfully.
    However, in conferring with past NomCom chairs, there appears to be some
    potential ambiguity. That ambiguity was raised during this retrospective
    process and several discussion questions were raised by the IETF LLC.

    This discussion concluded that IETF LLC should run an annual process in
    advance of the start of annual NomCom nominations (typically late August)
    for the community to comment on the requirements that will be sent to the
    NomCom for IETF LLC director roles. There was sufficient consensus that this
    was the best path forward even during the IASA2 retrospective process, so
    the IETF LLC started the process for the 2021 NomCom cycle, [as announced
    here](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ietf-announce/i60EmPaVHYKND5pim7NfCdiMDMM/),
    running from 2 August 2021 to 15 August 2021.

    The discussion also concluded that the correct body to perform this
    consultation was indeed the IETF LLC and not the IETF NomCom, particular
    since that would require potentially significant changes to the IETF
    NomCom's responsibilities as specified in RFC 8713. In addition, discussion
    also concluded that there should not be an explicit goal of a certain number
    of "independent" Directors, as this provides more flexibility in adapting to
    the changing needs of the IETF, because this can be called out in the annual
    IETF NomCom requirements for IETF LLC Director roles, and because the IETF
    LLC Board has the ability to appoint additional Directors as needed.

### [Section 7.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8711.html#name-financial-statements) - Financial Statements

35. **Requirement**: File an annual IRS Form 990, report on a regular basis to
    the IETF community on the current and future annual budget, budget forecasts
    vs. actuals over the course of a fiscal year, and on other significant
    projects as needed. This regular reporting to the IETF community is expected
    to be reported in the form of standard financial statements that reflect the
    income, expenses, assets, and liabilities of the IETF LLC.

    **Status:** 	&#x1F7E2; Achieved

    **Comments:** As noted in Requirement 22 above, see the [financial
    statements](https://www.ietf.org/about/administration/financial-statements/)
    page, which includes links to budgets, financial statements and financial
    audits. In addition, as noted in Requirement 24, the LLC has provided all
    necessary tax and financial information to the Internet Society, via their
    Chief Financial Officer. The LLC's numbers are included in [ISOC's IRS Form
    990
    filings](https://www.internetsociety.org/about-internet-society/financial-reports/).

### [Section 7.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8711.html#name-bank-and-investment-account) - Bank and Investment Accounts

36. **Requirement**: The IETF LLC maintains its own bank account, separate and
    distinct from ISOC. The IETF LLC may at its discretion create additional
    accounts as needed. Similarly, the IETF LLC may create investment accounts
    in support of its financial goals and objectives as needed.

    **Status:** &#x1F7E2; Achieved

    **Comments:** The IETF LLC has established bank and investment accounts that
    are independent of the Internet Society.

### [Section 7.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8711.html#name-financial-audits) - Investment Accounts

37. **Requirement**: The IETF LLC is expected to retain and work with an
    independent auditor. Reports from the auditor are expected to be shared with
    the IETF community and other groups and organizations as needed or as
    required by law.

    **Status:** &#x1F7E2; Achieved

    **Comments:** As noted in Requirement 22 above, see the [financial
    statements](https://www.ietf.org/about/administration/financial-statements/)
    page, which includes links to budgets, financial statements and financial
    audits. In addition, as noted in Requirement 24, the LLC has provided all
    necessary tax and financial information to the Internet Society, via their
    Chief Financial Officer. The LLC's numbers are included in [ISOC's IRS Form
    990
    filings](https://www.internetsociety.org/about-internet-society/financial-reports/).

### [Section 7.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8711.html#name-isoc-financial-support) - ISOC Financial Support

38. **Requirement**: ISOC currently provides significant financial support to
    the IETF LLC. Exhibit B of the [IETF LLC Agreement
    ](https://www.ietf.org/documents/180/IETF-LLC-Agreement.pdf) summarizes the
    financial support from ISOC for the foreseeable future. It is expected that
    this support will be periodically reviewed and revised, via a cooperative
    assessment process between ISOC and the IETF LLC.
 
    **Status:** &#x1F7E2; Achieved

    **Comments:** A new agreement with ISOC was [announced on 30 November
    2020](https://www.ietf.org/blog/isoc-financial-commitment/). The executed 16
    November 2020 [agreement is
    posted](https://www.ietf.org/media/documents/IETF_Funding_Agreement_-_Executed_-_20201123.pdf),
    as is a [brief amendment
    ](https://www.ietf.org/media/documents/IETF_ISOC_Funding_Amendment_Amendment_-_20201222.pdf)
    from 22 December 2020.

### [Section 7.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8711.html#name-ietf-meeting-revenues) - IETF Meeting Revenues

39. **Requirement**: Meeting revenues are another important source of funding
    that supports the IETF, coming mainly from the fees paid by IETF meeting
    participants. The IETF Executive Director sets those meeting fees, in
    consultation with other IETF LLC staff and the IETF community, with approval
    by the IETF LLC Board. Setting these fees and projecting the number of
    participants at future meetings is a key part of the annual budget process.

    **Status:** &#x1F7E2; Achieved / On Track with Caveat

    **Comments:** The only change to meeting fees was the introduction of an
    online meeting fee, which was necessary as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic
    forcing the IETF to temporarily shift away from in-person meetings. In this
    case, fees were proposed and adjusted based on community feedback and in a
    manner to ensure the continued financial stability of the IETF.

    _In retrospect, there should have been earlier consultation on the fees and
    specifically the fee waiver system._ While the Board initially assessed that
    the fee waiver system already in place for regular meetings should apply to
    online meetings too (including the need to motivate a fee waiver request),
    this was rejected strongly by the community. In summary, it is our
    assessment that while the LLC mis-stepped initially, it rapidly adjusted the
    plans for IETF-108 based on community feedback and quickly reached consensus
    on its final plans.

    Initial signs of health issues that would affect IETF-107 taking place in
    March 2020 in Vancouver led to an [advisory concerning travel
    restrictions](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ietf-announce/hNRWBvEwgwQIapmNtw2EP1uIS1o/)
    on 2 February 2020 and a note that the IETF was [continuing to monitor the
    situation](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ietf-announce/TA9rALRWCqB2Y1AX9XjSWeX31-w/)
    and would offer refunds on 12 February 2020. This was followed by an update[
    on 24 February
    2020](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ietf-announce/legMcsx2H_OEVLVtyESt_O-7qmY/)
    that the LLC was monitoring events and potential issues that may prevent
    meeting in person in March 2020 and a further update on [4 March
    2020](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ietf-announce/uMUo7ib0WfVmnXeulBl0-RqENcs/).
    This culminated in an [announcement on 10 March
    2020](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ietf-announce/WnC93yQanxb1GhOGYU97vFxc5RU/)
    that IETF-107 would not take place in person, refunds would be processed,
    and that a short virtual meeting would instead be held. The LLC also
    announced a process to analyze the financial impacts of the need to hold
    meetings exclusively online for some period and an intent to explore a
    potential insurance claim resulting from cancellation of IETF-107 (which was
    later successfully paid in the amount of $426,118).

    A change to meeting fees was motivated in response to the events that
    followed the World Health Organization's [pandemic declaration on 11 March
    2020](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/transcripts/who-audio-emergencies-coronavirus-press-conference-full-and-final-11mar2020.pdf?sfvrsn=cb432bb3_2),
    which confirmed the LLC's concern that meetings would need to move entirely
    online for the foreseeable future. In the remaining weeks of March 2020,
    countries around the world began to implement travel restrictions and bans,
    as well as stay-at-home orders - initially fairly short-term in nature. The
    world's understanding of the nature, potential severity, and likely long
    duration further developed through late March and early April 2020. The IETF
    LLC meeting fee assessment process began with an initial consultation
    concerning the move to online meetings on [16 April
    2020](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ietf-announce/IEfubIxgzcSC8wbNDRGgOU2sqck/),
    then a [survey on 29 April

    announced on 28 May 2020, announcement of first [online-only meeting
    registration](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ietf-announce/BPNyTxka355XbY03VSBtjl5y_So/)
    on 8 June 2020 which included a fee waiver program based on community
    feedback, [proposed change to and consultation on the fee waiver
    program](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ietf-announce/fVsDPW9hbgx5mflHpt7C39uFD0s/)
    based on community feedback, and [finalization of the fee waiver
    program](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ietf-announce/B6mndcJUVrU1tNkx0ueVQkawlLU/)
    for IETF-108 on 19 June 2020.

    The adjusted budgets, based around reduced fees and reduced sponsorship
    levels, have proven sufficiently accurate with all online meetings making a
    small surplus/loss, as budgeted.

    While the LLC at the time identified an area of improvement to the fee
    consultation process, in retrospect we believe that in the bigger picture
    the shift to online meetings was executed successfully in the face of an
    unprecedented global crisis, in the short period of time necessitated by
    these unforeseen external events, and with minimal financial impact to the
    organization, preserving a key revenue stream and ensuring the ongoing
    financial stability of the IETF.  Our [reforecast 2020
    budget](https://www.ietf.org/media/documents/ietf-2020-budget-reforecast-f1-approved.pdf)
    and [2020 Audited

    provide further details.

### [Section 7.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8711.html#name-sponsorships-and-donations-) - Sponsorships and Donations to the IETF LLC

40. **Requirement**: Sponsorships and donations are an essential component of
    the financial support for the IETF. Within the general bounds noted in
    Section 7.8, the IETF LLC is responsible for fundraising activities in order
    to establish, maintain, and grow a strong foundation of donation revenues.
    This can and does include both direct financial contributions as well as
    in-kind contributions, such as equipment, software licenses, and services.

    Sponsorships and donations to the IETF LLC do not (and must not) convey to
    sponsors and donors any special oversight or direct influence over the
    IETF's technical work or other activities of the IETF or IETF LLC. This
    helps ensure that no undue influence may be ascribed to those from whom
    funds are raised, and so helps to maintain an open and consensus-based IETF
    standards process.

    To the extent that the IETF LLC needs to undertake any significant special
    projects for the IETF, the IETF LLC may need to fund-raise distinctly for
    those special projects. As a result, the IETF LLC may conduct fundraising to
    support the IETF in general as well as one or more special fundraising
    efforts (which may also be accounted for distinctly and be held in a
    separate bank account or investment, as needed).

    **Status:** &#x1F7E2; Achieved / On Track

    **Comments:** The [new 2020 agreement with the Internet
    Society](https://www.ietf.org/blog/isoc-financial-commitment/) created a new
    fundraising matching funds program, designed to help create a strong
    foundation from which to accelerate new fundraising.

    A [revised sponsorship
    program](https://www.ietf.org/blog/revised-ietf-sponsorship-program/) was
    then announced on 2 March 2021. In the new structure, most opportunities are
    presented as annual or multi-year commitments with benefits that extend
    across and beyond meetings. In addition, there are new values-based
    categories to support running code, diversity and inclusion, and
    sustainability. These include programs such as IETF Hackathons, meeting
    registration fee waivers, and initiatives designed to reduce our impact on
    the environment.  Meeting-focused opportunities remain a part of the mix. An
    organization may host a meeting not already supported by a Global Host.
    Likewise, separate welcome reception sponsorship opportunities remain, and
    organizations local to an in-person meeting may be a sponsor for that
    meeting. Equipment and services sponsors will continue to be recognized for
    the  support they provide our community's ongoing operations.

    Finally, the hiring of a Director of Development [was
    announced](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ietf-announce/x9Aacw1UlNqAoQSxbJbyrZZ8IPU/)
    on 8 June 2021 and that person is in charge of leading fundraising for the
    IETF. Their hiring reflects the priority that the LLC places on this
    critical activity.

### [Section 7.7](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8711.html#name-focus-of-funding-support) - Focus of Funding Support

41. **Requirement**: The IETF LLC exists to support the IETF, IAB, and IRTF.
    Therefore, the IETF LLC's funding and all revenues, in-kind contributions,
    and other income that comprise that funding shall be used solely to support
    activities related to the IETF, IAB, IRTF, and RFC Editor, and for no other
    purposes.

    **Status:** &#x1F7E2; Achieved

    **Comments:** The LLC does not fund programs or groups beyond those
    specified in this requirement, which also includes the IETF Trust. In
    addition, the LLC develops the IETF's annual budget in a bottoms-up manner,
    based on the cost estimates and plans provided by these programs and groups.

### [Section 7.8](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8711.html#name-charitable-fundraising-prac) - Charitable Fundraising Practices

42. **Requirement**: When the IETF LLC conducts fundraising, it substantiates
    charitable contributions on behalf of ISOC -- meaning that according to
    United States tax law, the IETF LLC must send a written acknowledgment of
    contributions to donors. The IETF LLC evaluates and facilitates state,
    federal, and other applicable law and regulatory compliance for ISOC and/or
    the LLC with respect to such fundraising activities. In addition, the IETF
    LLC ensures that all fundraising activities are conducted in compliance with
    any policies developed by the IETF LLC, including but not limited to those
    noted in [Section
    8](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8711.html#name-ietf-llc-policies).

    **Status:** &#x1F7E2; Achieved

    **Comments:** As noted in Requirement 24, the LLC has provided all necessary
    tax and financial information to the Internet Society, via their Chief
    Financial Officer. The LLC's numbers are included in [ISOC's IRS Form 990
    filings](https://www.internetsociety.org/about-internet-society/financial-reports/).
    This fundraising is done consistent with various IETF LLC policies, such as
    the [OFAC Compliance
    Policy](https://www.ietf.org/media/documents/IETF_LLC_OFAC_Compliance_Policy_2020-10-06.pdf)
    and [Charitable Contribution Acceptance
    Policy](https://www.ietf.org/media/documents/IETF_LLC_Charitable_Contribution_Acceptance_Policy_2020-07-13.pdf).

### [Section 7.9](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8711.html#name-operating-reserve) - Operating Reserves

43. **Requirement**: An initial target operating reserve has been specified in
    Exhibit B of the [IETF LLC
    Agreement](https://www.ietf.org/documents/180/IETF-LLC-Agreement.pdf). It
    says that the IETF LLC should maintain an operating reserve equal to the
    IETF LLC's budgeted Net Loss for 2019 multiplied times three. The IETF LLC,
    in cooperation with ISOC, may regularly review the financial target for this
    reserve fund, as noted in the  [IETF LLC
    Agreement](https://www.ietf.org/documents/180/IETF-LLC-Agreement.pdf) or as
    otherwise necessary.

    Should the IETF LLC generate an annual budget surplus, it may choose to
    direct all or part of the surplus towards the growth of the operating
    reserve.

    **Status:** &#x1F7E2; Achieved / With Suggested Action Items

    **Comments:** The LLC continued to maintain an operating reserve fund. As of
    June 2021, the operating reserve balance is over $5,200,0001. The LLC
    believes this reserve is sufficient at this time, based on the
    organization's projected expenses.

    In addition, we propose two financial-related actions that should be made a
    part of the IETF LLC's annual budget process. First, the LLC should annually
    update and specify the financial target for reserve-related funds. Second,
    the LLC should annually review all reserve-related funds and the [Investment
    Policy](https://www.ietf.org/media/documents/IETF_IPS_ADOPTED_20191218_REDACTED.pdf),
    and update these as necessary. These reviews would be best timed to coincide
    with the annual budget process.

### [Section 7.10](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8711.html#name-annual-budget-process) - Annual Budget Process

44. **Requirement**: As noted in [Section
    4.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8711.html#name-general-ietf-llc-responsibi),
    the IETF LLC is responsible for managing the IETF's finances and budget. A
    key part of this responsibility is establishing, maintaining, and
    successfully meeting an annual budget. This is essential to the continued
    operation and vibrancy of the IETF's technical activities and establishes
    trust with ISOC, sponsors, and donors that funds are being appropriately
    spent, and that financial oversight is being conducted properly. This is
    also essential to the IETF LLC meeting applicable legal and tax requirements
    and is a core part of the Board's fiduciary responsibilities.

    As explained in [Section
    5.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8711.html#name-ietf-executive-director-and),
    the IETF Executive Director is expected to develop, execute, and report on
    the annual budget. Regular reporting is expected to include forecast vs.
    budget statements, including updated projections of income and expenses for
    the full fiscal year.

    The Board, as explained in [Section
    5.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8711.html#name-ietf-llc-board-responsibili),
    is expected to review and approve the budget, as well as to provide ongoing
    oversight of the budget and of any other significant financial matters.

    The annual budget is expected to be developed in an open, transparent, and
    collaborative manner, in accordance with [Section
    4.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8711.html#name-ietf-llc-working-principles).
    The specific timeline for the development, review, and approval of the IETF
    LLC annual budget is established by the Board and may be revised as needed.

    **Status:** &#x1F7E2; Achieved

    **Comments:** The LLC and the IETF Executive Director have followed this
    process for developing an annual budget and reporting financial results. As
    noted in Requirement 22 above, see the [financial
    statements](https://www.ietf.org/about/administration/financial-statements/)
    page, which includes links to budgets, financial statements, and financial
    audits.

    To use fiscal year 2020 as an example of this in practice, the budget was
    developed in a bottom-up manner that led to the [draft budget
    narrative](https://www.ietf.org/blog/2020-draft-budget-narrative/) and
    request for feedback on 11 November 2020. This was followed by publication
    of a [draft 2020 budget for
    comment](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ietf-announce/MZlLqTm8GuEp8dM6BDD8GshdIag/),
    announced by email on 13 November 2019, and a [final 2020
    budget](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ietf-announce/xOqaqzpfq-tImBduFoDc4ueEvXg/)
    on 16 January 2020.

    As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic forcing a shift to online meetings and
    upending the LLC's budget, IETF-107 was canceled and this led to the LLC
    immediately discussing a revised budget to reflect a new operating model for
    the IETF if this might also impact IETF-108 or subsequent meetings. Those
    financial discussions were originally recorded in the minutes of the [12
    March
    2020](https://www.ietf.org/media/documents/2020-03-12-llc-board-minutes.pdf)
    Board meeting, followed by discussions recorded in the minutes of meetings
    on [26 March
    2020](https://www.ietf.org/media/documents/2020-03-26-llc-board-minutes.pdf),
    [9 April
    2020](https://www.ietf.org/media/documents/2020-04-09-llc-board-minutes.pdf),
    and [14 May
    2020](https://www.ietf.org/media/documents/2020-05-14-llc-board-minutes.pdf).
    An update on the 2020 budget reforecast was noted in minutes from the [11
    June
    2020](https://www.ietf.org/media/documents/2020-06-11-llc-board-minutes.pdf)
    board meeting with the goal to complete the reforecast by the end of
    June 2020. In the [9 July
    2020](https://www.ietf.org/media/documents/2020-07-09-llc-board-minutes.pdf)
    board meeting, the budget reforecast was approved. This was also announced
    on [29 July
    2020](https://www.ietf.org/media/documents/slides-108-ietf-sessa-ietf-llc-briefing-for-ietf-108-02.pdf)
    during the plenary session of IETF-108. The LLC's financial statements
    reflected this new budget beginning with the [July 2020 financial
    statement](https://www.ietf.org/media/documents/July_2020_FS.pdf) and
    continuing for the remainder of the financial year. The [2020 fiscal year
    audit
    report](https://www.ietf.org/media/documents/2020_Audited_Financials.pdf)
    has also now been published.

### [Section 8](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8711.html#name-ietf-llc-policies) - IETF LLC Policies

45. **Requirement**: The Board is expected to maintain policies as necessary to
    achieve the goals of the IETF LLC, meet transparency expectations of the
    community, comply with applicable laws or regulations, or for other reasons
    as appropriate. All policies are expected to be developed with input from
    the IETF community. Some policies provided by ISOC and past policies
    developed by the previous IAOC may provide a useful starting point for the
    Board to consider.

    **Status:** &#x1F7E2; Achieved

    **Comments:** See [Policies &
    Procedures](https://www.ietf.org/about/administration/policies-procedures/ )
    on the LLC website. These policies were developed based on an extensive
    community consultation that occurred over a period of months. The framework
    and timing of the consultation was [announced on 11 June
    2019](https://www.ietf.org/blog/ietf-llc-draft-policies-comment/). This
    included creation of a new [mailing
    list](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/llc-consultation/), a
    [project on GitHub](https://github.com/ietf-llc/policies-consultation) where
    the draft documents were maintained and people could open issues or propose
    changes directly (via pull request), a live webinar with Q&A ([available for
    playback](https://ietf.webex.com/recordingservice/sites/ietf/recording/playback/c60be744639447d49782fc314247db71)
    for those unable to attend live), and a further revision of the draft
    policies. This was followed by [finalization of the initial policies on 7
    November 2020](https://www.ietf.org/blog/ietf-llc-policies-published/).

    The LLC remains open to suggested changes to existing policies or the
    creation of new policies. One example of a policy being updated based on a
    [community
    request](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ietf-announce/jvUfHT9d3rZlZItbqOB4_XasqwQ/)
    was the [updated LLC Meeting Minutes

### [Section 8.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8711.html#name-compliance) - Compliance

48. **Requirement**: The IETF LLC is expected to implement a compliance program
    to ensure its compliance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations,
    including without limitation laws governing bribery, anti-terrorism
    sanctions, export controls, data protection/privacy, as well as other
    applicable policies noted in Section 8. In addition, actions and activities
    of the IETF LLC must be consistent with 501(c)(3) purposes.

    The IETF LLC is expected to report to ISOC and the IETF community on the
    implementation of its compliance plan on an annual basis.

    **Status:** &#x1F7E2; Achieved

    **Comments:** Compliance reports have been published on the [LLC
    Reports](https://www.ietf.org/about/administration/reports/) page

## B. [IASA 2.0 Design Team Recommendations](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-haberman-iasa20dt-recs-03)

Comment on this section: This expired draft is not authoritative, as BCP 101 or
other BCPs/RFCs are. However, we felt it may be useful to include (we'd
encourage comment on that), as we have found that it can sometimes provide
additional context and motivation for the goals and requirements that did end up
in the authoritative documents.

### [Section 4](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-haberman-iasa20dt-recs-03#section-4) - Goals

(See also [Section 6.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-haberman-iasa20dt-recs-03#section-6.1))

49. **Requirement**: Protect the IETF's Culture and Technical Work: Ensure that
    the future IASA organizational structure and processes preserve and protect
    the IETF's unique culture of individual contribution, clear separation of
    financial support from technical work, as well as the "rough consensus and
    running code" approach to the development of open Internet standards.

    **Status:** &#x1F7E2; Achieved

    **Comments:** The IETF's culture and technical work continues along the same
    path it was on prior to the IASA2 changes.

50. **Requirement**: Improve the IETF's Technical Environment. Undertake changes
    to better enable technical contributors to focus more on that technical work
    and less on administrative work or support activities.  This could for
    example mean directing more financial resources towards the creation of new
    or improvement of existing tools, which might be produced by contractors
    rather than solely by volunteers.  As a result, volunteers could instead
    focus on developing the standards themselves.  Thus, if the core competency
    of IETF attendees and their reason for participating in the IETF is to
    develop standards, then create an environment where they can focus
    exclusively on that activity and delegate to contractors, staff, or other
    resources the responsibility for creating and maintaining tools and
    processes to support this activity.

    **Status:** &#x1F7E1; In Progress

    **Comments:** This remains a key focus for the LLC, as there continues to be
    technical debt that needs to be addressed, and the IETF wishes to move
    towards more modern software architecture, systems architecture, software
    development practices and user-centered design.  The current short-term
    focus is migrating core services off of tools.ietf.org onto managed IETF
    servers with a mix of like-for-like services, switching to new services
    (such as from Trac to GitHub) and replacing existing services with enhanced
    functionality. Resourcing continues to be a limiting factor and the LLC has
    increased the use of existing contractors, cultivated new contractors, and
    employed two new Senior Software Development Engineers to address this
    limitation, thus providing more capacity to take on a greater volume of
    technical work.

    We also observed that tension arose in the process of working towards
    meeting this requirement, as the LLC attempted (as required) to better
    define roles, responsibilities, and accountability between contractors and
    volunteers - especially when an individual was simultaneously both a
    contractor and a volunteer in a specific context. This appears to have been
    resolved and as the technical platforms of the IETF evolve it appears that
    roles, responsibilities, and accountabilities are becoming more clear-cut
    and easier to understand.

51. **Requirement**: Clearly Define the IETF-ISOC Relationship: Define the roles
    of IETF and ISOC in a way that helps the above structure be as clear as
    possible, in terms of who does what, how are things accounted for, and who
    is in charge of adjustments and control (e.g., staff resources).  This also
    includes consideration of a new funding model that takes into account the
    historical responsibility for the IETF that ISOC has had since its
    inception.

    **Status:** &#x1F7E2; Achieved

    **Comments:** As documented in [RFC
    8712](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8712.html) and noted in Requirement
    38, a new agreement with ISOC was [announced on 30 November
    2020](https://www.ietf.org/blog/isoc-financial-commitment/). The executed 16
    November 2020 [agreement is
    posted](https://www.ietf.org/media/documents/IETF_Funding_Agreement_-_Executed_-_20201123.pdf),
    as is a [brief amendment
    ](https://www.ietf.org/media/documents/IETF_ISOC_Funding_Amendment_Amendment_-_20201222.pdf)from
    22 December 2020.  Successfully establishing the IETF LLC legally and in
    operation has contributed to the clarity sought in the Design Team draft.

52. **Requirement**: Support a Re-Envisioned Funding Model: Provide the staff
    support and resources needed to adapt the funding model of the IETF to
    changes in the industry, participation, and expenses.  The structure should
    also allow for and be able to support new funding streams or changes to the
    proportion of funds from various Sources.

    **Status:** &#x1F7E2; Achieved / On Track

    **Comments:** As noted in Requirement 38, a new agreement with ISOC was
    [announced on 30 November
    2020](https://www.ietf.org/blog/isoc-financial-commitment/), which includes
    a novel new matching funds component. The executed 16 November 2020
    [agreement is
    posted](https://www.ietf.org/media/documents/IETF_Funding_Agreement_-_Executed_-_20201123.pdf),
    as is a [brief amendment
    ](https://www.ietf.org/media/documents/IETF_ISOC_Funding_Amendment_Amendment_-_20201222.pdf)from
    22 December 2020. In addition, as noted previously, there is now a fee
    structure in place for [online
    meetings](https://www.ietf.org/blog/ietf108-registration-fees/) to react to
    pandemic-driven changes in how we can meet, a [revised sponsorship
    program](https://www.ietf.org/blog/revised-ietf-sponsorship-program/), and a
    new[ Director of
    Development](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ietf-announce/x9Aacw1UlNqAoQSxbJbyrZZ8IPU/)
    on staff. The LLC anticipates that over the next 5 to 10 years that the
    funding sources will diversify as a result of these changes and investments.

53. **Requirement**: Provide Clarity About the IETF-ISOC Financial Arrangements:
    A redesign needs to clear up ambiguities in the financial arrangements
    between IETF and ISOC.  It must also be clear to people outside the IETF and
    ISOC organizations (e.g., sponsors) what the arrangements are and what their
    contributions affect and do not affect.

    **Status:** &#x1F7E2; Achieved

    **Comments:** As documented in [RFC
    8712](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8712.html) and noted in Requirement
    38, a new agreement with ISOC was [announced on 30 November
    2020](https://www.ietf.org/blog/isoc-financial-commitment/). The executed 16
    November 2020 [agreement is

    ](https://www.ietf.org/media/documents/IETF_ISOC_Funding_Amendment_Amendment_-_20201222.pdf)from
    22 December 2020.

54. **Requirement**: Clarify Overall Roles and Responsibilities: Ensure that all
    staff, contractor, and volunteer roles are clearly documented.  This
    necessarily includes documenting how each of these parties may interact or
    interface with one another in order to conduct and support the business of
    the IETF.  This also includes documenting key work processes,
    decision-making processes and authority (such as pertaining to meeting venue
    selection), etc.  A key objective is to minimize ambiguity and uncertainty
    so that it is clear who is responsible for what and who has the power to
    make certain decisions.

    There also needs to be a clear definition of what issues belong to the IESG
    vs. the IASA organization or staff.  In many cases that is not clear today.

    **Status:** &#x1F7E2; Achieved

    **Comments:** The LLC believes that this was achieved via the various [RFCs
    from the IASA2 working
    group](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/iasa2/documents/) and the associated
    contracts and formative documents that initially created the LLC, as well as
    [initial
    policies](https://www.ietf.org/about/administration/policies-procedures/),
    [contractor
    agreements](https://www.ietf.org/about/administration/rfps-and-contracts/),
    and [delegated authorities
    policy](https://www.ietf.org/media/documents/IETF_LLC_Delegated_Authorities_2020-06-11.pdf).
    Recently, an additional effort has also started to consider the potential
    need for and form of an anti-trust policy as noted in [an
    Internet-Draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-halpern-gendispatch-antitrust/)
    and [mailing list
    discussion](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/gendispatch/?q=gendispatch-antitrust).
    However, in attempting to meet this requirement the LLC experienced some
    challenges in clarifying roles and responsibilities in cases when an
    individual may be both a contractor as well as a volunteer (see also the
    response to Requirement 50 above).

55. **Requirement**: Define Support Staff Roles and Responsibilities: Clearly
    define the roles of the oversight entities and staff/contractors to match
    the expanded work scope facing the IETF.  Ensure that any changes create a
    structure that can adapt flexibly to future growth and other changes
    (including changes in IETF community expectations, such as increased
    transparency or more rapid decision-making).

    **Status:** &#x1F7E2; Achieved

    **Comments:** This was achieved via the various [RFCs from the IASA2 working
    group](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/iasa2/documents/) and the associated
    contracts and formative documents that initially created the LLC. See also
    the response above to Requirement 50. In addition, while the initial steps
    taken to increase transparency were a big step in the right direction, the
    LLC continues to work to strengthen and improve engagement and feedback
    processes with the IETF community (noting the challenge in how that
    community is defined and the wide range of mechanisms for feedback, as well
    as a first [IETF-wide community
    survey](https://www.ietf.org/blog/first-annual-ietf-community-survey/)). We
    also acknowledge that the pandemic has made it impossible to have the
    informal hallway, break time, or meal time interactions that so often
    provide an additional channel for feedback. We believe once face-to-face
    meetings return that being able to resume these informal interactions will
    further improve the LLC's ability to receive and act on feedback.

56. **Requirement**: Re-define the Role of the IETF Community in relation to
    Administrative Activities: As the roles and responsibilities for support
    staff and volunteer roles are clarified more precisely, the role of the IETF
    community in relation to those staff and volunteer roles must be better
    defined.  This should acknowledge the limited time and availability of IETF
    volunteers, better defining expectations around oversight of and involvement
    in strategic, operational, and execution tasks within the administrative
    efforts.

    The new design needs to ensure that volunteers are not overloaded in such
    things as low level operational decisions, which can be delegated to and
    handled by staff, and can instead focus on strategic changes, critical
    decisions, and so on.  In particular, this should focus on clearly
    documenting the lines between responsibility, representation, authority, and
    oversight.

    **Status:** &#x1F7E2; Achieved

    **Comments:** This was achieved via the various [RFCs from the IASA2 working
    group](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/iasa2/documents/) and the associated
    contracts and formative documents that initially created the LLC. See also
    the response above to Requirement 50.

57. **Requirement**: Define Improved Transparency Requirements: The general
    level of operational transparency and information-sharing between IETF
    administrative staff and groups to the IETF community must be kept at an
    acceptable level, and improved where it makes sense in the future. This
    includes ensuring the timeliness of sharing of information and decisions, as
    well as seeking comment on prospective decisions.  At the same time, we need
    to reset expectations around delegated authority so that once staff or an
    administrative support organization has been delegated certain authority it
    is clear that they are empowered to proceed in a particular area, so as to
    improve organizational efficiency, reduce friction, and improve the pace of
    work and decision-making. However, it is clear that enabling a group or
    staff to act within their delegated authority depends upon a clearer
    definition of roles and responsibilities, on improved transparency, on
    improved communications, and on trust (which is built upon all of those
    things over time).

    **Status:** &#x1F7E2; Achieved

    **Comments:** This was achieved via the various [RFCs from the IASA2 working
    group](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/iasa2/documents/) and the associated
    contracts and formative documents that initially created the LLC. See also

    Policy](https://www.ietf.org/about/administration/policies-procedures/community-engagement-policy/).
    See also the response to Requirement 55 above.

58. **Requirement**: Define a Transition Plan: Determine what new IASA structure
    we need and define a transition plan from the model the IETF has today to
    the new structure.

    **Status:** &#x1F7E2; Achieved

    **Comments:** This requirement was met and documented in [this transition
    plan](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ietf-announce/8r8NFnfTx2rlWKBavNz8zHRve-w/).

### [Section 5.3.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-haberman-iasa20dt-recs-03#section-5.3.1) - Board Selection

59. **Requirement**: Experience with selection for the IAOC and the ISOC Board
    shows the difficulty of using the NomCom process to select a board with the
    kind of business skills necessary to supervise an operation like
    IETFAdminOrg.  These skills are not common -- though also not non-existent
    -- within the IETF community, which makes it hard to find candidates as well
    as reducing the chance that NomCom members will have the personal contacts
    to identify external candidates with the appropriate skills.  For this
    reason, the design team does not believe that direct NomCom selection of the
    whole board will be successful.  In the ISOC Subsidiary model, ISOC might
    also nominate some board members.  Below we present two alternative
    mechanisms for selecting the remaining board members, though there are
    others that would perhaps be successful.  Regardless of the nomination
    mechanism, the entire board should be subject to confirmation by the IETF
    Leadership.

    **Status:** &#x1F7E2; Achieved

    **Comments:** See Requirement 34 above.

### [Section 5.5 ](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-haberman-iasa20dt-recs-03#section-5.5)- Staff Structure

60. **Requirement**: The design team believes that staff resources need to
    increase and/or be reorganized in order to move from one director to a few
    more specialized roles.

    **Status:** &#x1F7E2; Achieved

    **Comments:** The organizational changes have been made and staff hired.

### [Section 5.6.2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-haberman-iasa20dt-recs-03#section-5.6.2) - Funding Sources and Stability

61. **Requirement**: See the [several paragraphs in the IASA2 Design Team
    Recommendations
    document](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-haberman-iasa20dt-recs-03#section-5.6.2),
    which concludes with a main point:

    > ...developing a sustainable funding plan
    for the IETF will be a key project during the early months and years
    post-IASA 2.0.  Ultimately a healthier funding model will require raising
    more funds from the organizations that benefit from IETF standards and whose
    employees participate in the IETF, and may result in less reliance on ISOC
    funds.  Such a model might incorporate meeting-based sponsorships as we have
    traditionally had, other kinds of sponsorships, a fully funded endowment, a
    different registration fee structure, or other funding vehicles.

    **Status:** &#x1F7E1; Partly Achieved / In Progress

    **Comments:** During the IASA2 transition and bootstrapping process, we are
    pleased that pre-existing sponsors and funding was maintained. In addition,
    a [new funding
    agreement](https://www.ietf.org/blog/isoc-financial-commitment/) with a
    novel matching program has been agreed upon with ISOC. There is also a
    [revised sponsorship
    program](https://www.ietf.org/blog/revised-ietf-sponsorship-program/) that
    is successfully attracting interest and incremental funding, a [revised
    endowment
    policy](https://www.ietf.org/about/administration/policies-procedures/endowment-policy/),
    a structure for [online-only meeting registration
    fees](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ietf-announce/B6mndcJUVrU1tNkx0ueVQkawlLU/),
    and a newly hired Director of Development to lead the IETF's fundraising
    efforts. These are all long-term efforts that will take time to bear fruit.

    However, one area for action is determining what the meeting registration
    structure should look like for a post-COVID-19 era of hybrid meetings. On 30
    August 2021, the IETF LLC opened [a
    consultation](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ietf-announce/Pw1FOZyVnfyxBLADDwqdiMZW4E0/)
    on this question and associated issues. In addition, the IESG is in the
    process of rechartering the [SHMOO working
    group](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/shmoo/about/) to expand its focus
    from online meetings to hybrid meetings. This will now be the subject of an
    upcoming IETF LLC-IESG-IAB-IRTF leadership workshop in 2021. Finally, it is
    expected that IETF-113 in March 2022 may be the first hybrid IETF meeting.

    See also an associated recommendation in Section E below.

### [Section 5.6.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-haberman-iasa20dt-recs-03#section-5.6.3) - Funding Level

62. **Requirement**:  See the [several paragraphs in the linked
    document](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-haberman-iasa20dt-recs-03#section-5.6.3),
    which includes the key requirements to: improve the accounting of
    IETF-related costs, ensure realism in the budget, [maintain] ISOC as a
    funder and backstop, [maintain an] appropriate funding level.

    **Status:** &#x1F7E2; Achieved

    **Comments:** See the responses to many of the Requirements above, including
    numbers 2, 10, 11, 12, 22, 23, 31, 35, 36, 37, 39, 41, 43, and 44. In
    addition, looking specifically at the past and future funding levels from
    ISOC, the first two years were specified at the time the LLC was formed,
    while the new agreement in 2020 specifies six additional years, as
    graphically represented here:

## C. Other RFCs

Other RFCs were published in the IASA2 series. These are cited here for
completeness but did not have specific and actionable requirements for the IETF
LLC per se. As a result, no requirements are enumerated for these RFCs and the
IETF LLC is in compliance with each one as necessary.

- [RFC 8712](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8712.html) - The IETF-ISOC
  Relationship
- [RFC 8713](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8713.html) - IAB, IESG, IETF
  Trust, and IETF LLC Selection, Confirmation, and Recall Process: Operation of
  the IETF Nominating and Recall Committees
- [RFC 8714](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8714.html) - Update to the
  Process for Selection of Trustees for the IETF Trust
- [RFC 8715](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8715.html) - IETF Administrative
  Support Activity 2.0: Update to the Process for Selection of Trustees for the
  IETF Trust
- [RFC 8716](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8716.html) - Update to the IETF
  Anti-Harassment Procedures for the Replacement of the IETF Administrative
  Oversight Committee (IAOC) with the IETF Administration LLC
- [RFC 8717](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8717.html) - IETF Administrative
  Support Activity 2.0: Consolidated Updates to IETF Administrative Terminology
- [RFC 8721](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8721.html) - Advice to the
  Trustees of the IETF Trust on Rights to Be Granted in IETF Documents


63. **Requirement**: Comply with these additional IASA2-related RFCs as
    necessary

    **Status:** &#x1F7E2; Achieved

    **Comments:** Before IASA2, the same people were members of the IAOC and the
    IETF Trust. A side effect of the IASA2 change was that different people
    serve in the IETF LLC and IETF Trust, potentially creating some distance
    where there was none before while also bringing the benefit of more
    specialized legal knowledge & experience for those people serving the IETF
    Trust. At the same time, the unusual structure of the IETF Trust makes those
    that serve in the IETF Trust personally financially liable for the IETF
    Trust. This has historically been mitigated by obtaining liability insurance
    for members of the IETF Trust, but it has in the past few years become
    impossible to further increase that insurance.

     As a result it seems beneficial for the IETF community to explore potential
     changes to the legal structure of the IETF Trust. There are at least two
     major options for achieving this, if not more. We suggest that the IETF
     Trust should conduct a community consultation concerning this issue and
     potential future changes in legal structure for the IETF Trust that would
     better protect those experts that serve the IETF Trust while also
     maintaining close alignment with the IETF.

## D. Other Gaps

The IETF LLC also asked an open-ended question of the IETF community, seeking
suggestions on any additional administrative, financial, legal, or operational
gaps; areas of improvement; and any areas of under-specification or
over-specification in IASA2 documents that the IETF LLC Board, IETF Secretariat,
IETF Executive Director, or the IETF community perceive that have not already
been addressed in prior sections of this document. No comments were received in
this area that have not already been addressed in prior sections of this
document.

Finally, the IETF LLC specifically asked whether retrospectives like this should
be performed in the future and the feedback was that this did have value. The
associated action item for that has been noted below in Section E.

## E. Recommendations for Future Work

1. The IETF LLC should conduct a regular assessment of the IASA structure and
   IETF LLC every three years, with a report to the IETF community in the final
   IETF meeting of each of those years. Based on this IASA2 retrospective being
   completed in 2021, the next IASA assessments should occur in 2024, 2027,
   2030, 2033, and so on.

   The point of performing a regular assessment is that the IETF's way of
   working and its needs will continue to evolve, while the external environment
   will also change. Thus, periodically checking in to see whether there are
   structural, process, financial, operational, legal, or other administrative
   adaptations are needed makes sense. As well, by making small changes on an
   incremental basis, the risks associated with each change is likely to be
   smaller because the changes are correspondingly smaller, and there is a
   regular check-in every three years at which point the IETF can assess the
   effectiveness of any change so that modest course corrections can be made.
   Finally, keeping up with internal and external changes may also potentially
   help the IETF avoid large once-a-decade administrative structure changes that
   are multi-year efforts like IASA2 - and this is not only a time-saver but
   also lets IETF leaders and participants remain more focused on the core
   standards work of the IETF.

   In addition, as the IETF evolves how the organization wishes to work and meet
   in a post-COVID world, such as potentially changing meeting frequency,
   reducing in-person venue size requirements, shifting to hybrid meetings, and
   so on, the IETF LLC will need to adapt to provide the necessary
   administrative, operational, legal, financial, and other support to meet the
   changing needs of the IETF.

2. As noted in the comments part of Requirement 43, we recommend a two
   financial-related actions that should be made a part of the IETF LLC's annual
   budget process. First, the LLC should annually update and specify the
   financial target for reserve-related funds. Second, the LLC should annually
   review all reserve-related funds and the [Investment
   Policy](https://www.ietf.org/media/documents/IETF_IPS_ADOPTED_20191218_REDACTED.pdf),
   and update these as necessary. These reviews would be best timed to coincide
   with the annual budget process.

3. As noted in the comments part of Requirement 63, we recommend that the IETF
   Trust initiate a community consultation concerning improvements in their
   legal structure.
